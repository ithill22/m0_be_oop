# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - Definitely the most difficult challenges so far. But I actually really enjoyed it. Once you got into a rhythm, the time flew by.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I am having no problem staying focused. I am to zone in and work for hours. I probably shoul be taking more breaks but I get sucked in and forget to.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    - I need to make sure I am getting up early to go to the gym. Get out of the house as often as possible. Check ins would be appreciated. I sometimes don't look out for myself when I am ultra focused
